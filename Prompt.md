prompts:

I am building a Kanban board using React and Vite. Suggest a clean component structure for a beginner‑friendly but scalable implementation. I want to manage state at the top level and pass data via props.

In a React Kanban board, what is the best way to manage tasks so that moving tasks between columns updates the UI automatically? I want to follow the proper React state approach instead of manual DOM manipulation.

How can I persist my React state in localStorage so that my Kanban tasks remain after page refresh? Please explain the role of useEffect and the best pattern to initialize state from storage.

My Kanban board UI works but looks very basic. Suggest simple but professional CSS improvements (spacing, colors, card styling) while keeping the design clean and not over‑engineered.

In my React task card, I want the task text to turn into an input field when clicked and save on button press. What is the cleanest way to implement this using useState inside the card component?
